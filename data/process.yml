  Whenever possible, I practice a user-centered design (UCD) process. 
  I start by understanding the needs, wants, and abilities of the target user. Depending on the domain I'm working in, several methods can be used at this stage, such as field research, literature review, competitive analysis, and surveys. Based on both qualitative and quantitative data from these methods, I extract important themes and patterns, which I then translate into design opportunities. 
  Ideation and brainstorming follows, and with methods like grounded theory analysis, affinity diagrams,personas, and storyboarding I can par the pool down to a few worthy design candidates. 
  From them, I prototype the design solutions, find the one that works best and fully implement that one. 
  Once I have something that's testable, I iteratively evaluate, analyze, and improve the product.

  I like to think of myself as an end-to-end prototyper, in the sense that I'm drawn to all stages of the UCD process. In particular, I'm a big fan of prototyping and building. I find that creating something tangible that can be put into users' hands is extremely fulfilling. It gives me a chance to validate design decisions that were made earlier and can lead to more refined prototypes in further iterations.
